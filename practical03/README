The are codes for practical 3
To compile:
gcc -o use_printf use_printf.c
\\In this exercise we used printf function to print two integers and two float numbers

gcc -o trap trap.c -lm
\\In this exercised we calculated the area under the curve of f(x)function using the trapezoidal rule, where the "for loop" was used to execute the iteration.

gcc -o trap2 trap2.c -lm
\\In this exercised we calculated the area under the curve of f(x)function using the trapezoidal rule, where the "while loop" was used to execute the iteration.
